# Real-Time Air Quality & Health Risk Predictor

An AI-powered web application that analyzes real-time air pollution data and predicts health risks using machine learning.
The system fetches live air quality data for any city, analyzes pollutant levels, and provides personalized health risk insights through an interactive dashboard.

---

## Project Overview

Air pollution has become one of the most critical environmental and public health challenges worldwide. Most existing applications only show Air Quality Index (AQI) values without explaining what those numbers mean for human health.

This project solves that problem by combining:

* Real-time AQI data from APIs
* Machine Learning-based risk prediction
* Interactive data visualization
* Health risk interpretation

The application provides an easy-to-understand dashboard that helps users understand pollution levels and potential health risks.

## Features

* Real-time air quality data for any city
* Automatic location detection
* Interactive pollution charts
* AQI gauge visualization
* Health risk classification based on AQI
* Machine learning prediction for air quality category
* Modern Streamlit dashboard UI

---

## Machine Learning Model

The project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict air quality categories based on pollutant values.

### Model Inputs

* AQI Value
* PM2.5
* PM10
* NO₂
* CO
* Ozone

### Model Output

* Air Quality Category Prediction

Example predictions include:

* Good
* Moderate
* Unhealthy
* Very Unhealthy
* Hazardous
